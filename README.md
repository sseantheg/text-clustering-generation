# text-clustering-generation
a text clustering and generation task that I worked on.

# Task details

Consider the following scenario: a process generates a set of sequences, and each sequence is encoded as a sequence of characters.   There is an undisclosed number of distinct processes so it should be possible to group the sequences into clusters of similar sequences.   However, in addition, some sequences have been generated by another unrelated process to form outliers.   Each instance is either an inlier or an outlier. 

 

You have two tasks: task 1 is to cluster the inliers into an appropriate number of groups; task 2 is to generate a novel prototypical sequence for each cluster, i.e. a sequence that is the most representative for that cluster. Note that the prototypical sequence must be novel, i.e. not one of the provided sequences.

 

You may use any machine learning library or software package. We provide a single text file, test.txt,   which contains a random mixture of inlier and outlier sequences in no particular order.   Each row of this contains an integer identifier for the sequence and the sequence itself.  

 

Please organise and execute your code in a Jupyter/IPython notebook and provide cells where you 1) print for each sequenceâ€™s identifier together with the cluster-ID they belong or that they are an outlier, and 2) print one novel prototypical sequence for each cluster you have found.
